# DesignPatterns
My own cheat sheet for designe patterns.
## General Design Principle
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. 
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification (SOLID)
